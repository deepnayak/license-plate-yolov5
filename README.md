## Noteworthy features
- End to end system that makes use of a finely tuned machine learning model to detect license plates in any vehicle
- Users get a log of all the detections performed by the application
- Whatsapp Integration that sends intruder alerts on the owners mobile phone
- Supports Live Detection that makes use of the webcam feed to perform detections
- Supports Remote Detection that allows the user to use one's mobile phone camera and sends this video feed to the server wirelessly in real time
